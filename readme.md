## EXPERIENCE ##

#### Animo (October 2008) ####
Animo is a large-scale, distributed computing project which featured 8 different computers and cameras communicating and performing together to create a human-sized stop-motion animation across a wall 50 ft in length. Code Assistant to Zachary Lieberman.

#### Community Core Vision (December 2008 – August 2009) ####
Previously called TBeta, CCV aims to simplify blob tracking utilizing cameras. I constructed most of the framework, ported it to new tools and software, and created an API and hooks to extend its capabilities to any C++ code. Co-Lead Developer with Seth Sandler.

#### NUICode (December 2008 – August 2009) ####
Spearheaded development of this Ruby on Rails application. It is a private project management tool I crafted especially for NUI Inc. Features usage-analytics, data warehousing, and bug tracking with user roles, as well. We achieved over 300,000 downloads of our tools and files with this app.

#### BeenVerified Inc. (July 2010 – September 2010) ####
Played the role of Business Logic Analyst who developed server maintenance software, and hacked away at the core product to kill bugs. I experimented with new tech and methodologies with peers to speed up our large app and decreased bandwidth and resource usage many fold.

#### Codecademy (March 2012 - August 2012) ####
Contractor and Intern, frontend and backend. Designed and implimented a service to allow asynchronous message passing from a Rails app or Sidekiq process to the client via websockets. The system scales linearly. I also added feedback functionality to various aspects of the site and even created a few courses to show off jQuery functionality.
