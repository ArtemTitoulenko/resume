## Experience

**tl;dr:** Artem specializes in developing maintainable and robust systems that efficiently power critical business infrastructure. He is comfortable with many languages and tools; enabling companies to grow quickly and effortlessly.


#### SVRF, Lead Systems Architect (July 2016 - March 2020)

- Led project to create entire Kubernetes-backed production environment from scratch, with metrics monitoring, logging, and alerting infrastructure.
  - Wrote majority of the backend services using Node.js to be highly parallelizable and easy to debug.
  - Maintained and tuned an ElasticSearch cluster.
  - Developed a shared PostgreSQL-backed work queue for queue-based workers enabling high data pipeline throughput.

- Created an automated CI/CD system that coordinates deployment of interdependent services; shortening test times and enabling engineers to deploy code with confidence.

- Developed 360 and 3D Media Pipelines
  - Created a photo and video encoding pipeline which ensured all 360 media we served was available in a variety of sizes and bitrates for all clients.
  - Researched, planned, and developed data pipelines for processing and optimizing 3D models from a variety of formats (FBX, DAE) to glTF. These pipelines ensured that all models were efficiently optimized assets to perform on all devices.

- Developed custom glTF extensions to create feature parity with Snapchat and Instagram face filter experiences, without using a game engine.
  - Extensions were built into a forked Blender plugin, all of the libraries in our processing pipeline, the on-device glTF loading client, and a web-based glTF loading client.

- Led project to rebuild an aging Angular website in React using Next.js with an emphasis on fast loading.
  - Worked with our design team to build a design system to unify our products. Upheld code + design standards using tools like eslint and Storyboards.


#### Spring (November 2013 - May 2016)

- Software engineer at an early-stage startup, helped build a lot of first iterations of many foundational pieces of software, all in Go.

- Worked with UI/UX designers on prototyping and building out a vendor-facing product management system, used by all 1000+ vendors.
  - The system allowed vendors to import, sync, upload products from their inventory systems (Magento, Shopify, Demandware, csv imports, etc) or to use Spring's system.

- Part of team who built the Spring homepage (https://www.shopspring.com) using React, enabling users to shop, track their orders, and explore other brands on the web. Helped create SEO-focused changes to improve Google Shopping ranking. The site eventually responsible for the majority of revenue across the company.

- Collaborated on backend systems that normalize and keep remote inventory system products in sync with our DB, and how product changes affect customer purchases.

- Participated in regular on-call rotation, and helped develop and maintain DevOps systems.
  - Maintained on-prem Phabricator instance to facilitate more effective code reviews. Built internal tools to speed up code review process and unblock engineers. Worked on testing infrastructure to considerably reduce test duration, improve test result readability, and make testing as painless and consistent as possible.


#### Medium (June 2013 - August 2013)

- Intern, specializing in backend architecture and supporting libraries.

- Updated and maintained Dynamite, our home-grown DynamoDB client.

- Refactored, updated, and maintained zcache, our cache layer management and interface library.

- Collaborated with our Platform circle to decrease system latency six-fold and improve internal response times many more times than that.

- Worked on admin tools and patched vulnerabilities in user-facing services.


#### Codecademy (March 2012 - August 2012)

- Contractor and Intern, frontend and backend.

- Designed and implemented a messaging service alongside a Rails app to enable rudimentary user notifications, which sped up the critical path to rendering the next lesson, and maintained the ability to give the user feedback on their progress.

- Added feedback functionality to various parts of the site and even created a few courses to show off jQuery functionality.


#### HackerSchool, Batch[0] Summer 2011

- First batch of HackerSchool students.

- Dove into the depths of Ruby and created quite a few small projects and experiments, mainly around tracking programmer productivity.

- Experimented with Clojure and played with a forked Lisp interpreter to experiment adding functionality to a standard library.
